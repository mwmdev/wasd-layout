This layout is a custom design made for a [WASD VP3 62-Key ISO Custom](https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/wasd-vp3-62-key-iso-custom-mechanical-keyboard.html) mechanical keyboard. The [SVG](layout.svg) layout file follows WASD's specifications for layout design and can be used on their online shop to order a keyboard with custom design.

Used mostly with [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/), many custom key mappings and minor tweaks to _xmodmap_. With the use of modifiers, each key triggers up to 4 actions. The base layout is a french AZERTY, and spanish accented letters are also present.
